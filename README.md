# Factorio Mod Builder
Utility tool to aid in the creation of Factorio Mods

#### Goals
This tool aims to reduce the difficulty of creating mods for Factorio by 
providing a level of error checking and autocompletion that cannot exist in
simple text editors 

Currently, to use simply build the tool and run the generated executable.  Currently,
building the tool requires:  
**Microsoft Visual Studio 2013** (2012 and 2010 should work, but I haven't tried it)  
**Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5** (although it can probably target 3.5 without much issue)
